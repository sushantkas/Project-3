# Amazon Delivery Time Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict delivery times for Amazon e-commerce orders using various features such as product size, distance, traffic, and shipping method. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building regression models to estimate delivery times.

## Business Use Cases

- **Enhanced Delivery Logistics:** Predict delivery times to improve customer satisfaction and optimize delivery schedules.
- **Dynamic Traffic and Weather Adjustments:** Adjust delivery estimates based on current traffic and weather conditions.
- **Agent Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate agent efficiency and identify areas for improvement.

## Dataset

The dataset contains order details, delivery times, agent ratings, weather, traffic, and geolocation data.

## Project Structure

- `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data loading, cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3. Place the dataset file (`amazon_delivery.csv`) in the project directory.
4. Open and run `EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

## Usage

- Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering.
- Modify or extend the notebook to build and evaluate regression models for delivery time prediction.
